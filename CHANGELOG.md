- `SBBGroup`: Removed field `useBlackForDarkMode` to match the current specifications
- `SBBGroup`: Removed field `color` to match the current specifications
- `SBBSelect`: Removed field `modalButtonLabel` because the modal submit button has been removed to match the current specifications
- `SBBSelect`: Removed field `itemToString` because it is now obsolete due to the introduction of `SelectMenuItem<T>>` to match semantics of `DropdownButton`
- `SBBCheckbox`: Removed fields `mouseCursor`, `materialTapTargetSize`, `focusNode`, `autofocus`, `shape` and `side`
- `SBBRadioButton`: Removed fields `mouseCursor`, `toggleable`, `materialTapTargetSize`, `focusNode` and `autofocus`

### Fixed

- `SBBTertiaryButtonLarge`: Was still clickable in loading state
- `SBBRadioButton`: Completely reworked implementation from ground up because old implementation was very heavily based on the material `Radio` widget and therefore kept breaking from changes of the material widget that came with flutter updates
- `SBBCheckbox`: Completely reworked implementation from ground up because old implementation was very heavily based on the material `Checkbox` widget and therefore kept breaking from changes of the material widget that came with flutter updates
